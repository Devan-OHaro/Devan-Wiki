== Goal ==
I've played Dead Space twice now.
Once in the 2008 version and then I played the remake last year.
I like it so much I think it's worth trying to get a platnium trophy for, so that's what I'm doing.
I'll try and drop the trophy list and organization here soon.

I played yesterday.
I just finished chapter 2 and I had to go back since I missed one of the Markers for the Reunion (I think) trophy.
But, it was pretty easy overall, just story about Nicole and stuff.
I did notice, if you backtrack, they'll give you new Necromorphs to fight - not a lot, but still interesting.
