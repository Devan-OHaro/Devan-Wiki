Just finished Frieren for now. 
It was really good.
Lot's of life lessons in there I hop not to forget.
Mostly, it's about the small things, and not to have a tear-ful goodbye when you know you'll see them again.
Cool.

They just completed the labrynth for the second trial to become a first class mage.
Badass fight scenes.
Fitz said he'd probably like the show and I agree.
I have two episodes left and I'm ready to watch them and see how they finally finish the exams.
