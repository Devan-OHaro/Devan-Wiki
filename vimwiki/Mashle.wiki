= Mashle: Magic and Muscles =

I finished this show a few days ago, it's fun but not one I'm going to be stressing over for them to come out with another season.
The show ended at season two where they reveal that Mash is the bigbad's son and is going to be used to make him stronger or something.
But there was a pretty long fight scene between all the big wizards of the show at the end with the student's lives at stake.
Obviously Mash saved them and kinda proved that even though he's "normal" he deserves to be at the school with everyone and become a divine visionary.

Just resumed this one.
I'm definitely forgetting some stuff, but it is a really enjoyable anime with plot being secondary.
They just let Mash stay in the school since he doesn't have magic, and he went out with his friends for the day and got a heavy wand.
After that one of the divine visionaries seems to have put a hit on mash and now some music guys are after him, but not before being intercepted by the sword divine visionary dude.
They're currently at Mash's "dad's" house having fun and I think the Divine Visionary competition or whatever is about to happen.
