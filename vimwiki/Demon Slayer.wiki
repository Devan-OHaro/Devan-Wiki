We watched a few episodes today.
It pretty much started out with Tanjiro convincing the water Hashira to do the training with the other.
He didn't want to because he believed that since that one kid ghost that helped Tanjiro at the beginning of the show risked his life to save the water Hashira, he didn't deserve to live.
But of course, Tanjiro convinced him.
Then Tanjiro set out training with the flashy Hashira and helped his teammates all join together to train harder "against" the teacher.
He moved to the mist Hashira and convinced him to be nicer to all the other demon slayers while training them.
Finally he moved on to the girl Hashira and then we realized that the rest of the show wasn't dubbed yet, so we stopped.
I'm excited for the rest of this arc, it seems really cool meeting everyone and seeing the training process.
I feel like I'm also getting a lot of messages about the value of life and the one's around you.
It's important to not throw the life everyone gave you away.

I just started the Hashira training arc.
Still some unknowns, like why the one Hashira, the one that started Tanjiro on his journey, isn't participating.
But the Hashira started training the demon slayers to awaken their mark or something.
Finally, the crow went to the medical demon to ask her to analyze Nezuko and her sunlight ability.
We have yet to see how Tanjiro makes the cut.
