Collin and I started this last night with three episodes then did two more today.
It's pretty good, but it started off a little stiff.
The whole show is about AI's being introduced to humanity and, we as the audience, know that there will be a catostrophic war between humans and the AI in a hundred years from when the story starts.
An AI is sent back to this time to warn about the war and the one he is tasked to help fix this is a Diva singer AI.
The whole show is based around events the future AI warns the Diva about so she can stop them.
Meanwhile she is trying to fufill her "mission" to make people happy by singing from her "heart".
So, she is slowly learning more and more about being human (ironically enough from AI mostly).
She stopped someone from dying to a bomb, she stopped a congressman from dying in a building explosion, she stopped a space hotel from falling out of the sky, and now she's trying to stop an AI island from funcitoning.
As far as I can tell, these events she's stopping seem surface level bad, but it's weird how the future AI is directing everything and spinning it all in a bad way even though a second though will make you think it's bad that she's doing some of these things.
We'll see, I got to figure out how to watch it with Collin in California.
