= Devan Consciousness Project =

This project's goal is to upload as much data from my life as I can and have that data be something to reference in infering memories, thoughts, and feelings into a chatbot.
Starting from scratch, I had a few goals in mind including learning how to work with data in general.
As this is a lofty goal, I know that I have a proclivity to quit when it get's hard or boring.
But the end-product of what I want is very important to me so I need to keep that in mind during this process.
I'll do my best!

I want to do my best to keep this going, and I've found that keeping to my goals is easiest when recorded, so I know why I'm doing it.
With reflection, I believe that I can at least get very far.
