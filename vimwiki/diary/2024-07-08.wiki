About to go to work.
I feel a little bleh right now.
Maybe it's from all the shitty eating i've done recently, but I can't wait for these countertops so that I can actually prepare some veggies.
I did have some asparagus yesterday so I can't be too mad at myself.
Though it was surrounded by a bunch of unhealthy stuff.
Anyway I need to contact some people today as noted by my list.
Also, I have my first meeting today for the Git stuff at work.
Excited, but also scared.
I just want it to go smoothly.

Work kinda sucked.
It was just long, but I was in a rhythm.
We just rescheduled Aaron and Marissa's for a lame reason.
Fitz didn't feel up to it, so I said we both didn't want to go, which was kinda true.
I want to find the time to go this week, soon.
I also want to fix this wiki.
Time for Fallout NV.

Played some NV, now I'm thinking I'm going to watch some TV.
I really want to have a gummy, but I feel like I should take a break.
