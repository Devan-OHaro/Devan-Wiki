We're about to go to Aunt Kelly's for Christmas eve stuff.
The night before yesterday, I got high and ate way too much food.
I still haven't watched Dandadan.
Anyways, the next day (yesterday) my stomach was hurting all day.
I really noticed when dad and I were grocery shopping for Christmas Eve stuff since Mackenzie didn't go.
After shopping and getting the best deal ever for a beef tenderloin ($150 on sale for $120 but the cashier rung it up for $80), I just hung out on my phone and took a nap with the weighted blanket.
Watched a bunch of Warhammer stuff on the TV and then went down for some salad and pasta.
Played the *20 Ways to Win* deck against Collin and lost three times in a row.
After that I went to bed.
This morning, I went to the Doctor and Dr. Ambinder brought the mood down a little by talking about the posible 2nd bone-marror transplant.
But, everything looked good otherwise - my blood was good all the scans and biopsies were good.
So, then I played some games with Collin and Abby and then had some Lox as well as a donut.
Talked to Fitz and played Shogi with Collin.
Now, we're just waiting to go to the Christmas Eve's celbrations.
