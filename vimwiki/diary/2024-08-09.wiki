Last night after Sam and Meredith left for their soccor game, I just played some games, had an edible, and watched YouTube.
The video on YouTube I watched was actually super interesting.
It was talking about how RTS games are actually more beginner friendly than I orginally thought.
It basically framed the whole learning process in easy to understand formats talking about multitasking (starting with one thing and moving to two and so on) and build orders for the beginning of the game like openings in chess and so on.
It was interesting and I'm more inclined to start learning AoE2 now.
Other than that I worked on Dictionaries today in my python learning and I'm about to update that diary.
