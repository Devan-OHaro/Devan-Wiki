I'm really trying my best to have a positive outlook, but it's getting harder and harder.
Today I got a call that the insurance didn't go throiugh because they were missing the percent of the lymphoblasts in the marrow.
Not a big deal, but the caller said it needs to be less than 5 percent which I'm pretty sure it's not - if I recall correctly, it was at 7 last biopsy.
I don't know what this means, but there's more.
My pain is really bad today and just feeling this daily makes me feel worse and worse and less and less hopeful.
I saw a new perspective on my CT scan from the ER and they said I had a pulmonary node (not a big deal as far as I can tell) and some calcification of my coranary arteries.
I'm sure that's been there for a while from all the chemo treatment, but it's just another thing I have to start fighting at 29.
It's just hard seeing the other side of this thing and on top of that seeing a positive version of coming out the other side of this.
I'm not in the mood to talk, to eat, to play games, and I know this isn't good.
I want to have the positive outlook and hope, but I just don't know how.
All I can think of is to get through this time and try my best to keep doing my life regardless.
