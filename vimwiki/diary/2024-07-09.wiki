[[To-Do]]

Tue Jul  9 06:19:39 PM EDT 2024

I finished Solo leveling yesterday (at least caught up).
It was pretty good, a nice finally with him battling some tough enemies and then getting the necromancy power.
I also did the Fallout stuff.
Tomorrow I have a dentist appointment and Aaron and Marissa's.
I'm not exctied that I have to spend more leave for tomorrow, but it's not the worst thing in the world.
I think I'm going to have a gummy today - it's just nice.
I also have to decide what progress I'm going to make in my hobbies - video games or anime or what.
I want to start the LeetCode thing again.
I'll add it to the to-do.
