[[To-Do]]

Woke up a bit ago and was feeling lazy so I doom-scrolled for a bit until I went to the kitchen.
I saw some of the tools I could clean up and one thing lead to another and then I cleaned the majority of the dining room.
Sent Roomba-San on his way and we're off to a better start than I expected.
Probably going to go to Home Depot now and get a sink and look at some light fixtures.
After that maybe I can start designing this "bar" in the dining room.
I also called another floor guy, I hope he gets back to me soon.

Went to Home Depot, got a faucet, got a car-wash.
After a call with dad we came up with some ideas for the light above the sink that included a spacer of PVC.
Anyway started watching Vinland Saga and the countertop guys are going to insall in about two hours.
