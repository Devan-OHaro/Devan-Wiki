I just woke up, this is pretty late.
I wonder what's going on. maybe just less motivation to do things right now.
I really enjoyed this time off, it was nice to do nothing.
I'm still wondering about Maire to be honest.
Should I try and continue our terrible texting?
Should I just invite her out again?

Just played some rocket league.
Won more than I lost, but I feel bad since I should be playing the other million games I'm in.
I need to update my Wiki.

Alright, did a lot.
Went to the dump with Fitz and got the majority of the trash out.
At least all the stuff on the porch, so that's nice.
Then, we went grocery shopping - I was a little over butdget due to som NA beers.
Finally I got three more subway sandwiches and this roast beef and provolone (toasted) is really good, it's just simple with some mayo, lettuce, onion, and S&P.

Talked to Mackenzie about a boy she met and about Maire.
Played some New Vegas.
Really enjoyed my NA beer and sandwich.
I texted Marissa about our anime tomorrow and I'm going to bring Aaron a torque wrench.
