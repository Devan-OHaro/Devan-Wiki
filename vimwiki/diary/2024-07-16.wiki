[[To-Do]]

I went to work today.
It was normal, sending emails, going to training with Sweeney for Phase II stuff.
Then I finally couldn't take it anymore, so I called the hospital.
They told me it could be bad - this lymphnode could be recurrence, PTLD, or some weird infection.
All cases seem to be rare.
We're looking to schedule a biopsy tomorrow and we'll go from there.
Still haven't got the biopsy scheduled which is what really sucks.
Not only do I not know what this is, but I don't have any time-frame for when I'll find out.
If it's bad, I really don't know what I'll do.
I don't know how to proceed.
I just told Fitz about it, and he's helping me feel better about it.
