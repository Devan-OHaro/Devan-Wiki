I got home a few hours ago.
Since then, I've caught up with Fitz and went on a grocery store run.
We've been binging some Demon Slayer, it's getting really good.
Yeah, it's been nice being back and just relaxing.
I need to call mom and dad to let them know how it's going, so I'll probably do that before watching some Vinland Saga.
I'm going to update my Demon Slayer journal, call the parents, watch some Vinland Saga, and then maybe continue my "Note-taking" journey.
I'm feeling pretty good, not too sad about things.
I feel a little anxious about my work situation, but we gotta make it work somehow.
