[[To-Do]]

I'm honestly really struggling with this whole ordeal.
I don't know what this lymphnode stuff is and it all seems pretty scary.
I tried to go to work today, but could only stay about two hours because I was so emotional.
Mom is flying in tomorrow to take care of me at the hospital for my surgery.
I have a lot of toughts on my mind about all this stuff, most of them aren't fun to think about.
I'll put some here just in case:
I want to start recording my voice with everything I remember about this world; I'll go through Facebook friends and list off everything I remember about those people, I'll list everything I can remember about TV shows and Games, I'll record every piece of my life that I can put together and every thought I've ever had and hopefully compile it all into a book or something.
Then, I want to finish everything I can that has been put on pause, again TV shows, games, outings, etc.
To be honest, I'm really scared about the results of this biopsy.
Oh yeah, I watched Dune last night.
