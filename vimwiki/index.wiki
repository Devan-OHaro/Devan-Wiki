== Actual VimWiki/Diary Notes ==

Soon, I should organize this wiki actually.

Things I've learned:

Diary:
* <Leader> w i 		- Goes to Diary
* <Leader> w <Leader> y - Goes to YESTERDAY'S daily entry
* <Leader> w <Leader> i - Updates Diary to include daily entries
* <Leader> w <Leader> m - Note for tomorrow
* <Leader> w <Leader> t - Goes to TOMORROW'S daily entry
* <Leader> w <Leader> w - Goes to TODAY'S daily entry
* <C-<up-arrow>		- Previous day
* <C-<down-arrow>	- Next day

Checkboxes:
* <C-Space> 		- toggle a checkbox
* gnt			- Find next checkbox
* gl<Space>		- Delete checkbox
* gL<Space>		- Delete checkbox and all sibling checkboxes
* gln			- Increase doneness of checkbox
* glp			- Decrease doneness of checkbox
