I finished part I this morning.
I have to say, other than the straightforward story, the book is confusing me so far.
I won't go into the themes and details, but it feels like it's all over the place with it's philosphy.
I'm not sure if I like the main character too.
I think I just have to keep on reading for it to make more sense.
But, for now, I feel this way and I'll keep just trying to finish the book which is better than over-analyzing it and then being detered to read it... and then never read it.
