I finished this yesterday.
I thought it was fantastic, and I'm sad I have to wait for an unknown forth season.
It was so good I flew through it and didn't have time to put it here even if I wanted to.
The character dynamics are so good.
Kazuma with everyone is fantastic and I love the relationship between him and - basically his sister - Aqua.
The others are kinda romantic interests, but Megumine is too young and she's really cool, but that would be weird.
Darkness on the other hand took a back seat in the show for a while until the last half of season 3.
She was the focus, but the only annoying part of the show in my opinion is them just not giving enough for the romance between the two.
The scenes always fall short to a joke and no one takes it seriously.
I'm considering the Manga just so I can get the end of the story, but I have to work on "My dress-up darling" first.
Anyway, they just finished the third season, so season four should be announced soon.
Darkness just got out of the marriage she was forced into after Kazuma payed the debt that her family covered for him.
I know there's gotta be more, so I'm excited to see how it goes.
