Just resumed this one.
I'm definitely forgetting some stuff, but it is a really enjoyable anime with plot being secondary.
They just let Mash stay in the school since he doesn't have magic, and he went out with his friends for the day and got a heavy wand.
After that one of the divine visionaries seems to have put a hit on mash and now some music guys are after him, but not before being intercepted by the sword divine visionary dude.
They're currently at Mash's "dad's" house having fun and I think the Divine Visionary competition or whatever is about to happen.
