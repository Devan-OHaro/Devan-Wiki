Just updating this now (again), but it was pretty good.
Mostly just the main character doing his job change quest.
It was difficult and fun to watch the boss fight.
Super cool power of necromancy in the season finally.
We'll see where that takes him in the next season.

Just updating this now, but last night I wached some solo-leveling to catch up with where I was at.
I rewatched some episodes.
He killed that one executive that was blood thirsty through his dungeons and now has a target on his back since it was a S-rank's brother.
Then he tricked some buisiness into buying their C-rank dungeons.
Yeah nothing crazy, just getting the work in to become A-rank.
