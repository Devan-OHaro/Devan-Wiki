I'm not really going to keep a log of this show because I finished it.
I didn't journal my experience once during it, but it was a pretty fantastic romcom.
I watched it with Collin and I'm glad I did.
It was a good bonding experience and we finished it right before I left him in California.
There was so much to it, and it was relatively deep for a romcom in terms of the romance element (there wasn't much more).
The deepest character was the other male lead who played the video games and slacked off a bunch (never learned names).
But I would be interested in reading the manga after I forget the show a little more.
This show will always hold a special place in my heart for many reasons - I saw it's memes from a while before watching it and loved the characters, it had lovable characters, it was funny, and most importantly: Collin.
