I've been watching this the past few days.
It's a pretty simple concept where there is a god who wants to make his name known, so he completes tasks that people ask him to do with the help of his 'regalia'.
The show started off with his regalia quitting to show that his living circumstances aren't the best and she wanted to move on.
Then a highschool girl sees him in the street and saves him and loses her body in the process.
She's half-dead-half-alive so she sometimes slips out of her body after saving the god.
She wants his help to fix this situation, so she hires him and then basically needs to take care of the struggling god.
Later, he finds a new regalia who is a younger boy who died in an earlier life.
All we know is that his backstory is sad, but we don't know much more.
The god is quirky and abuses the people around him, but he does care for them at the same time.
Later he shows the highschool girl another god and regalia who are his friends essentially and says to go to them if he's ever in trouble.
These friends said that even though he's goofy, he's a scary god.
That's all we know and I'm excited to see his and his regalia's backstory.
