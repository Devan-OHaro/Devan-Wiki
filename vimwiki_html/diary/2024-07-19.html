<p>
I went into work today and left early.
I was not focusing at all on what I was supposed to do.
There was a microsoft outage across the country so the results were not supposed to come back today.
After talking to Brandon Oliver and Dcat about it, I left.
After I got home, Dr. Kelkar called and said the same leukemia cells were in the biopsy.
It allieveated me a little knowing it was the same stuff and not nothing new.
They said I caught it early so they're letting me go on the trip with Ryan and Sarah to Steve's wedding.
Once they know what the treatment will be, I'll know what I'll be doing in regards to life changes.
But for now, we got Forgarty's, are about to chill and go to Target tomorrow before Boston for our trips.
