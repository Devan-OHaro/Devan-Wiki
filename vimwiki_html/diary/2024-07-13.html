Yesterday the countertop got installed.
It looks pretty nice but finally the finish work is here.
I'm happy since I have a fully functioning kitchen now, but there still is some work to be done before I'm happy.
After installing the sink as soon as the countertop people left, we watched some Goblin Slayer.
I woke up this morning and we watched some more Goblin Slayer.
That is, after we finally (mostly) organized the dining room into the kitchen.
We also went to the grocery store to get stuff for Seans in about an hour.
I made my pasta salad.
About to play some games before we go.
Also, fitz is showing me some of his house prospects which I have mixed feelings about.
But his houses he's look at are super nice, so I'd be happy if he got any of them.

I went to Sean's and it was a good time.
Just a lot of hanging out and talking to the Maine Squad.
I got some quality time with everyone, even playing Cornhole with Kris Morgan, Vlad, and Travis (really close game...).
But, by far the most memorable part of it was Dcat and Haley asking me to do a speech.
Considering that they didn't want a wedding party, I'm super honored to be apart of their wedding in the first place.
I need to do more with them, I feel super valued.
They are good friends.
