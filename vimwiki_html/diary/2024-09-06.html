Collin and I went to the card shop to theory craft some decks and we ended up only buying a few packs, but in the end, the shop dude sent me a link to a Shrine deck I want to build.
We spent a lot of time there talking and thinking.
Once we got back, we figured the plan was to go to the "Prime rib" at the Live! casino place.
We had a fantastic dinner and I had a 32 oz prime rib that was amazing and a bunch of sides.
The dinner was very expensive, so I'm happy mom and dad were there.
We then went to the Casino and I was willing to spend big money and in the end I was up $110, but I'm not ignorant enough to think that I make money gambling.
I was willing to go so hard  yesterday probably because I might not get anohter chance to go so hard to the paint... who knows.
Anyway, I had fun except the drive home.
I went to bed shortly after we got home and then I woke up and played a LOT of Fallout NV since that seems to be my personality now.
I think that's part of the reason I was willing to spend so much money last night.
It's really good and I'm having fun before I have to spend endless days sick.
Oh, I almost forgot to mention, I helped Collin move some mulch, pelets, and fertilizer around with the Caboda yesterday before the card shop and I hit the fence with the Caboda.
I have some responsibility to help fix it.
I figured with all these chores that Dad is giving Collin I want to help Collin out, but I'm still not too keen on helping dad out.
I have to think more about that and why, but I'm sure the fight last December has something to do with it... I have to think about this more and why I just really don't want to help even though he helped my kitchen stuff and what not.
Well, I think I'm going to wait until I'm recruited to help with the fence fix that I caused.
I will feel bad if Collin does it without me, so I'll try and stay vigilant.
