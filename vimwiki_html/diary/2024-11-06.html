I went to TJ's wedding.
It was really cool to be doing that over the weekend.
So, Friday was the rehersal dinner and we practiced at TJ's house and then went to Turf Valley where I got crabcakes.
The highlight of the evening was Sam pulling up the Michael Jackson Hitler photo while I was telling a story about Mako's battery.
The next day was the bachelor party.
After I picked up my tux, we all met at TJ's and I drove to downtown ellicott city for us to go axe throwing, which I was surprisingly good at.
Then we went to Top Golf and I sucked there, but I still had a good time.
Finally we had dinner at Pheonix something or another in Ellicott city before ending the night.
The day of the wedding I wrote the speech which I'll find a way to drop into this wiki somewhere, and everything at the wedding was really nice.
The only hiccup I had was not bringing a pocket sqaure but we put a piece of paper there instead and it looked better than everyone's.
I did my speech which I thought went well overall, then was the rest of the reception and it all ended for an early night.
Haven't done much since other than just indulge in my nerdy hobbies and wonder what I should do with myself.
I'm currently in a weird place where I don't want to commit to anything or start a regiment of any sort because I don't want it to go away if my life changes again.
That could mean I have to go through another bone-marrow transplant or go back to Maine, I don't know.
I think it would be good for me if I did start something, but I have done it a MILLION times where I get into this good routine and it dissapears the second I move, or have to change my routine, or just get some crazy news.
Regardless, it would be good for me if I do something soon, but I'm at least waiting for my bone-marrow biopsy to come back so I have a general sense of what I need to do first.
Anyway, I have a few things to update in my interests/hobbies section.
