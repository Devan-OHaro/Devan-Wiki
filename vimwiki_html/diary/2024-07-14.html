Last night played some rocket league with TJ and Sam.
At first we tried to play Barotrauma with Chris, but he didn't get on in time so we switched and went on a pretty good streak for RL.
This morning I saw a house with Fitz and he's iffy about it.
We then went to BJ's and the mall in Newington to eat Jamician Beef patties and Frozen yogurt.
But the main purpose was to get fitted for a suit for TJ's wedding.
We just unpacked everything and I'm currently deciding how the rest of my day will go.
I should attempt some work on the kitchen, but at the same time I kinda just want to relax and play some video games or watch TV.
I'll probably relax.

I ended up starting season 2 of Goblin Slayer with Fitz.
Then I played some RL with Sam and TJ who were at Sam's house waiting for Chris to play some golf.
I want to play Barotrauma with them soon.
Now Fitz and I area making a Sunday supper with Duck, mashed potatoes and aspargus.

The dinner was awesome.
After that we watched some Goblin Slayer.
The kitchen worked out great for the intense meal cooking and cleaning.
