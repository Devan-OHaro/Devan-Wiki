Wow, I feel like I have a lot to talk about.
First, an update on what I've been doing the past week.
Monday, a week ago, Collin and I left to take him to Alameda, CA for his Coast Guard job.
It was a great bonding time.
Collin took the first shift, then I.
6 hours Collin, 7 hours me, 7 hours, 5 hours, Saw Kyle, 6 hours, 7 hours, 4 hours, 4 hours.
We got to see Kyle in Denver, CO super early in the morning, but he had to leave less than an hour into the Starbucks meetings since he had a dentist appointment.
The whole trip I spent reading "Komi Can't Communicate", my new book that Uncle Daniel got me, "Radical Remission", and playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses (that reminds me I have to add that to the video games.
I spent almost the whole driving time listening to Warhammer 40K lore and trying to learn more about the story and game.
It was awesome nerding out and talking to Collin the whole time.
We didn't really spend a lot of time stopping for things, it was almost straight through.
Out of the 48 hours it took to get there, 42-44 of it was driving; the other couple hours were stopping to see Kyle, Buc-ee's, and gas stops.
Once we got to CA, it was 3 in the morning there.
We didn't unpack or anything, just got in and slept.
The next morning, I met his roommate, Ben, who's a good kid.
After that, we had some breakfast, got haircuts, went to Ikea, unpacked everything from his truck, went to Target, and then had some Phillipeano (sp?) food.
Around the end of Ikea through the Target trip, I could tell Collin was getting a little tired of me - probably from all the opinions I was interjecting with all the time.
I mostly stayed silent during the Target run so that I wouldn't annoy him, but he almost didn't want me to go.
But since I did, I payed for his stuff there and the Pho/soup afterwards.
It was a long day, but the next day was a little more relaxed.
Collin and Ben were at the Coast Guard base and I hung out alone for a while, read my books and watched Warhammer Youtube.
Collin came home and we built his desk (1/3 furniture items), unfortunately after we started the dresser, we found that one of the major pieces was busted.
So, we put that one on hold and chilled for a while before going to the grocery store to buy some food.
We bought stuff for Stir-fry and then chickened out and bought Hawaiian food on the way home.
That's where we met a crazy homeless lady who asked us for food.
After I got her a smaller version of my meal with rice and chicken katsu, she exclaimed how "nasty" the "shit" was multiple times to me.
I made sure not to make a scene, especially when she shoved the food toward me after I got up to go to the bathroom.
I enjoyed my snap I took of her and as we left, we saw her pacing the building crazy-like.
The next day I had the morning to myself again and I really popped off in my head.
I read some GREAT chapters in the remission book about "Releasing suppressed emotions" and "Increasing Positive emotions" that got my head spinning.
After the suppressed emotions one, I watched a video of "Avatar the Last Airbender"'s chakra scene to see if there were some things that I could do to unblock those chakras.
I saw SO much negativity flow out of me when I thought about these things.
The biggest one was when the pleasure chakra was blocked by guilt and I tried to wipe away the guilt of all the stuff like work, and leaning on people, and so much more.
I just told myself that it was alright that I did/needed all that.
Cancer is hard and I don't think I've really sat down to think about that just yet, so I have to do that at some point.
Finally during this and a meditation session, I remembered a quote (I think from the remission book) something like "we are not the body or the mind, simply an observer".
I felt very out-of-body at the times I was reflecting.
I wasn't totally there, but I felt like I was close.
This made me super interested in the chakras since they can do powerful work like that.
The other thing I did while going through all this was modify my chatbot/life-database idea.
I'd like us to live on without fear, so to help facilitate that and journalling, and mindfulness I thought that the database should be an app I can access daily.
It definitely expands the scope of the project, but I think that the information will be segmented better this way through a daily, guided process.
I want the app to prompt the important stuff daily, like, journalling and other inputs like mood, gratitude (that one's new), and daily forgiveness and stuff like that.
And I also want the app to prompt for data points that it searches for in your entries and other fields for each thing.
For example, if you mention a sister, Mackenzie, or you manually input her during one of the daily prompts, maybe next it will ask for her contact information or an event that you participated in with her.
Maybe it will ask for a random year for you to explore and think of an idea you had or a feeling during a certain time of that year.
The point is, it will use the context of the data already put in there to ask for more specifics and then ask for new information... daily.
That way by a certain point, everything you remember will be logged.
And the most important function I wanted to add was the auto-send feature.
Basically, if you don't acknowledge the app, it will notify someone you trust and then take a second step to verify, and finally send all important information like passwords and this database to a trusted person.
This is meant to be when you die or something to that effect.
So the hard part of this app and the chatbot is to organize and create the database.
I have a first step and that is to make a script to ask for the daily forgiveness/gratitude in a daily entry like this one.
That's a good basic first step in my opinion.
Moving on to the rest of the day.
I felt moved at this point, but I was still able to hang out with Collin before I went out with Maire in Sausalito.
I took an hour uber to her place and then we walked through her town and saw some skylines and stuff.
I have some pictures of this time.
We ate some pizza and then walked back to her place.
We hung out, and she wasn't impressed when I leaned in for the kiss, but we got over the awkward part and moved on and had some really good conversations after that about AI and learning and personality types before I headed back.
This was also the last night I texted Jordan, a possible religious interest that lives in the Dulles area.
I think she lost interest at one point, so I'm not really texting first anymore.
Then Saturday, Collin and I hung out all day and chilled.
Commander, games, finished "Love is War" (thank god, we never finish animes together, so I'm happy we completed one).
We also worked out and ate at a really healthy spot (well, we had it delivered) called "Bob's fast food".
And then we made the stir-fry we planned from Thursday.
It was a great day with my brother.
the next day I woke up and we watched some Counter-Strike video and I packed and left for the airport.
It wasn't a crazy goodbye, but it was definitely meaningful - and by that I mean, we both knew we'd see each other soon, so it wasn't sad, but it felt good and it felt right.
Not goodbye, just a "can't wait to see you soon".
It marked a point where he came up to see me in Maine, we went to Maryland together when I was sick, and then after I got better, we went to California for the beginning of his adult life.
It felt good, and I love him a lot.
That's another thing, I'm trying to love more.
There are three chapters in the remission book I read on the flights that day that deal with loving yourself, recieving love, and experiencing universal love.
It's all crazy stuff I need to explore.
I also read a lot of Komi and tried to determine the best way to go about my spiritual journey.
I talked to mom when I got home in Maryland and we figured that looking at all the religions was a good path for me to explore, so I want to start with one and while I'm doing that look into the others.
I decided to start Buddihsm since it seems relatively easy to learn and practice - plus, it will give me some good meditation skills.
I need to be strict when it comes to these things if I'm going to do it though, so I'll do my best.
I also had coffee with Uncle Daniel and Brock in charge of the Ulman Foundation.
It was insightful to see how it could help me and how I could help it.
I need to connect with my community more according to the readings and other ideas I'm having, so, cancer community seems easy and meaningful enough.
Uncle Dan then went on to tell me more about his meditation journey and is trying to link me up with a coach that he said he's willing to pay for.
I have to explore this Tomek guy a little more before I ask him to pay for something like that for me.
He also talked about "Stargate" and "Monroe" stuff and how CIA was investigating these practices, it was wild and I'd like to look into it more.
But, for now, I just want to start with the basics and then maybe move to a retreat type thing in the future.
I also got my truck back today - they said nothing was wrong, which is good and bad.
Good, because nothing is wrong; bad, because I had to shell out $375 since there was nothing for warranty to cover.
Oh well.
I had some healthy food today and looked into supplements.
Well, I failed to look into supplements since the chatGPT conversation I had fell flat and I probably just have to do it all by hand.
Either way, I'm going to incorporate those into my daily routine.
Finally, I played some Dead Space and got pretty far into my platinum journey.
Oh yeah, I also found - with the help of dad - my Warhammer figures from 2004ish and my yugioh cards that might be worth something!
Next up, christmas shopping and painting figures from warhammer!
</p>

<p>
Forgiveness:
I forgive dad today for quickly turnin our conversations into what he wants and dominating all narrative.
He just wants his thoughts to come to fruition before he forgets, so he'll stop our conversation for his.
It's okay, dad, mom and I can circle back to what we want or not since it probably isn't actually all that important.
</p>

<p>
Gratitude:
I have a lot to be thankful for today, but if I were to focus on one thing it was the coffee meeting.
Mom made soup and dad brought me to the dealership to pick up my truck, but Brock and Uncle Daniel made a lot of time out of their day for me.
I'm thankful that I got to meet a new connection and I'm glad I got to strengthen my connection with my best "cancer-friend".
