Got back from the hospital today.
The surgeon who did the biopsy gave me a heads up that it's most likely malignant, meaning that I'll need treatment.
My head is racing.
I don't know what to do or how to do it.
Unfortunelty, I think I just have to wait until I talk to the doctor about the diagnosis and what treamment will be.
Most likely, I'm going to do it in Maryland, but again, we'll see.
I'm so confused.
