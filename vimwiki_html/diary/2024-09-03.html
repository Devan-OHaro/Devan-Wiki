Yesterday, I went to the game store in Eldersburg with Collin and Abby, got some storage for the cards, and then we got snacks for the Commander game.
At the commander game, I noticed it was Collin's Friend's parent's house, so that was a little funny when they thought I was in high-school and corrected them that I was a full-grown adult with a career and house and everything.
The ironiy of the situation is a little funny.
Anyway, these guys were classic nerds and it was fun to be there and play a 4 person game with 4 people instead of just Collin.
I liked my deck which just used everyone else's cards.
We had some good pizza and ate none of the snacks we bought from walmart.
Anyway, we ended the night by heading home and then I went to bed, nothing crazy.
I woke up this morning, emailed work and played some Fallout NV.
Collin laughed at some of the "traps" I fell into in the game.
Also, we saw my game crash like 3 times, so we attempted to fix it before I didn't care enough.
Anyway, I have to organize how I'm going to proceed with the day since I have a hospital appointment with Dr. Ambinder at 4pm and Sam invited me to the Oriole's game yesterday, so I accepted that and it starts at 6:30.
I guess I'll just wait in the city for them after my hospital appointment.
Sam didn't respond to my "cry for help" when I said I didn't know what to do, where to park, or how to wait for them since I didn't have the tickets.
Whatever, I'll probably just play on my phone or something.
