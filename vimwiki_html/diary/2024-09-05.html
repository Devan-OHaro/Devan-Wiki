Okay, so I went to the hospital after the last update and talked to Dr. Ambinder.
He seemed a little flustered, so I didn't give him too much grief on the lack of an answer about the transplant, but I would like to know sooner rather than later.
Then he scheduled me for 4 visits next week with a bone-marrow biopsy, so I'm not too thrilled.
Afterwards, I went to park in Little Italy, but Sam said he was only 10 minutes away, so I picked him up and parked there again for th O's game.
We met Luc and his girlfriend Victoria at "Pickles", a bar near the stadium, and hung out until everyone was there.
So, Chris and Jenny showed up and they had their friends too, then we met Courtney and her boyfriend Brian on the way to the stadium.
Watched the game from left field and the big joke was that a homerun was about to come our way the whole game.
It was a little boring when the O's got a 6 or 7 run lead in the first few innings, but we talked and had peanuts and it was fun overall.
After the game, I drove Chris and Jenny, and Courtney and Brian home, then Sam, then myself.
Sam was remarking how Baltimore is so nice since everyone lives so close, and for that reason alone.
But, I thought about it, and that's how it is in Maine for me.
Every one of my friends lives basically within 10 minutes of each other within two towns, so you can have that anywhere really.
Anyway, yesterday, the next day, I didn't have much time to waste because I had a phelbotomy appointment to check my platlets and then an infusion 3 hours later.
So, I told the staff I was going home in between that time and they weren't too thrilled, but it worked out perfectly.
I got to start a Magic game with Collin and hang out before going back and if I was there for the full 3 hours and then 2 hours for the appointment, I would have killed myself.
I got home finished the Magic game with Collin, snacked, played Fallout, ate dinner with the fam, had a gummy, ate too much late at night and my stomach let me know I fucked up.
Then I woke up this morning and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with/without Collin.
I want to play Fallout, but I want to hang out with him.
I'll talk to him, but fo rnow I'll update the Fallout diary.
