I didn't get a good chance to journal yesterday, but I've been really good these past few days.
Yesterday was a lot, but there isn't too much to talk about.
It started off after Collin got home in the middle of the night and said hi to me.
I woke up the next morning and had coffee with mom and dad and there wasn't much to say.
I started to warm up the soup since my later plan that day was to go to the Ravens/Pittsburg game and I wasn't sure about food.
So, as the soup was warming up, dad made some baked potatoes in the toaster oven that TJ gave me.
Collin and Abby came down and I showed them my shogi board and we talked about Christmas presents.
I started to prepare the soup and I made a bowl with the miso for everyone.
At that point I got ready for the cold of the game and Collin started looking through my <span id="-Secret Lair"></span><strong id="Secret Lair">Secret Lair</strong> "20 ways to win" deck and we realized there are a lot of good cards in there - the whole deck is a flex.
I ate the baked potato and left for Sam's.
I got up and said "hey" to his dad, then went to lunch where I got a salad and shared wings with Sam.
We went back, got stuff from Simon's car and left shortly after that.
It was cold, but Sam gave me hard and feet warmers and a pair of gloves to use.
Once there, Sam and I went to the upper deck area where we could watch the game from his dad's seats.
It was too cold to focus on much else other than that and the game.
I got hot chocolate and a hot dog at one point (both were actually really good for $12).
Then there was a point when the Ravens had won the game so people started leaving.
We met his dad and Simon near the tailgate area and then we made our way to Some italian resturaunt in little italy (something with the name "Chip" in it because Sam's dad kept talking about the "chip salad").
After I got the salad and a chicken parm, we left and went back to their place where Meredith was after being with her grandmother all day at the hospital.
I caught up with everyone and they exchanged presents.
Eariler that day Sam said he didn't want a sweatshirt with a certain color, so Sam's dad, Lee, gave it to me instead which was nice because I really like the color.
After the "Chicky parade" for twig I left shortly afterward.
I got home and had a bunch of cookies and snacks before passing out.
I did however get all my supplements in, so I'm proud.
But yeah, I ate pretty terribly yesterday.
Overall good day though.

Gratitude:
Last night I did a short meditation to make sure I finished in time and it was about gratitude.
I was thankful for being with everyone at the Ravens game, for Lee's gift, and just the general sense of belonging to so many wonderful people include that family and my own.

<p>
Forgiveness:
I forgive myself for the bad eating habits I partook in yesterday.
I enjoyed the day and still got many of my meaningful habits completed other than the programming work and journalling, but here I am.
I still did well.
