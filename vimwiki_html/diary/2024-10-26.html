I'm updating as much as I can remember from the past month or so (classic).
The big stuff I'll start with before I go into my camera roll and details is I was very sad around the time I stopped.
I don't think there was a specific reason other than the overbearing situation that I'm in, but it was bad enough that I was foggy and not mentally clear and I couldn't function very well.
I stopped gaming during this time and sociallizing and a lot of things where I basically just stayed in my room for most of the day and wasted time on YouTube.
I kinda still am doing that, but treatment is over for CAR-T, so I'm starting to get my counts and energy and motivation back.
I'm over Sam's and Meredith's right now and Sam is running to Eburg to see an old acquiantence (basketball coach) for his birthday while Meredith and I are doing this and she is doing schoolwork.
I got my Hickman and it's not actually that bad this time around.
I listened to the advise of nurses finally and got the press-n-seal wrap that actually does a really good job - better than the medical covers.
I got some cupcakes from the old neighborhood wives and they sucked, but I was happy to get them while I was in my sad-state.
I got goodies from Dcat and Haley like japanese candies and a lego which I still haven't put together yet, that made me super happy during my depression.
They're the best.
I did my twenty-some days in IPOP and mom came with me for most of them and made really good breakfasts most of them; I should thank her for that.
I got my CAR-T obviously during that time and there is a lot to update on the decision I'm in the middle of with regards to that, but I'll get to it later.
I got the fun urinary sympotms again this time around, but they were way worse with the clots and I had to wait an hour or so for some pees to actually come out after mechanically agitating everything.
I only went to the hospital once with all this.
I got a fever and lost my apetite for a few weeks after that.
The worst part of the visit was that they tried to put a PICC line in and they failed...
I was very upset and I think that's actually what started the sadness in addition to Mackenzie confiding in me that she was sad about Cameron and stuff (not sure if that was second breakup or what).
I lost a lot of weight and didn't cook a lot so I came down for small amounts of food and stayed upstairs for the most part - Collin (and Abby) were able to get me down a lot of the time and cheer me up when I was sad.
They would make food or whatever and I would eat a little - it was good.
After going through my reels a little with Fitz, I think I'm getting a little more (Otaku) nerdy.
I'm really liking the anime stuff and I just bought a manga the other day and read the first volume.
It was "My dress up darling" and it was really good and I want to keep going.
I also redownloaded Genshin Impact, but that will probably be short-lived.
Collin and I finished Attack on Titan - thank goodness he finally watched it with me (it was so good the second time around).
Fitz got really in to Naruto and the other update with him is his event with Sean at the October-fest thing (won't write about that).
But I will say that he stopped drinking and might want some help with his anxiety.
Okay, those are the big things.
The two things I'll go into detail for are the decision for my medical stuff and the Family incident.
We don't know what to do next for my cancer.
The next step is to get a biopsy and obviously that will guide our decision, but there is a lot to consider for if I want another transplant or not.
If the biosy says there's cancer and it isn't going away, the decision is made for us, but if that's not the case, then I need to decide.
Data is inconclusive at the point in CAR-T if people are more or less successful with a second transplant after a CAR-T course, doctor's don't have any real guidance on the idea, and we can't trust a "no cells detected" biopsy after last time.
It comes down to my gut at this point and I don't know.
We can kick it while it's down with a second transplant or we can let CAR-T do it's thing for as long as possible.
I don't know.
The second thing is the family incident.
Collin came up to me and told me that Dad made Mackenzie cry, and then we both went down to the kitchen to him yelling.
There was no solution to the fight other than to just leave.
We all yelled at dad for a while and he was mean to us meanwhile and it wasn't fun.
I am not happy with how I handled it because I was looking to fight and hopefully put dad in his place to admit he needed therepy or that he had a problem, but that's not the setting for that to happen.
So, in the end we all just left.
I think Dad did admit that therapy would help at some point during the night after I came back, but I won't hold my breath.
That's about that, the big stuff that still holding over is Mackenzie and Dad's relationship is a little strained and I am losing my social skills and motivation.
