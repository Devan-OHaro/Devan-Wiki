So, the last update was about the wedding.
Since then, I got really sick with Covid and something else.
Covid hit my sinuses and the other illness made me congested for like 3 weeks.
I'm still kinda sniffling and coughing.
Anyway, the big stuff that happened was Thanksgiving.
So, we had everyone on mom's side for early dinner and then my social battery drained, but I lasted longer than I normally do and I had some energy when talking to others.
Then, Courtney, Carly, Aunt Dawn and the Bachtiars came to the Beaumont for some drinks and I was able to successfully get them all to play Left, Center, Right and Jackbox games.
I'm glad I was able to get people to do that since it's the only thing that I can do once my battery is gone.
I also convinced Aidan and Eileen that there were Gazingees from when Pop told me about them.
They're the fake creature that I imagined to be deer-like with huge colorful antleers and hands that extended from their chest to grab children with.
That was funny.
Oh, and I also led a DnD session with Chris, Sam, TJ, Mackenzie, Collin, Abby, Carly as the one-shot that Johnny Bones led me through as my first session.
They all said they had fun, so I'm hoping to try again later.
I also had fun.
I fixed Saori's stand because the figurine broke at one point so I drilled out the peg that broke off from her foot and epoxied it back.
Collin just gave me a Hatsune Miku Christmas (2022) figurine for christmas this morning (early).
I really enjoy them even though it's uber nerdy and I'll have to hide them for the most part...
Anyway, I really got into the rythym game for Miku and it's actually super fun - I forgot how much I like music games.
I tried to start Fire Emblem: Three Houses, but I only got through the tutorial so far.
Collin came home from Texas Thanksgiving with Abby and her mom the day after Thanksgiving and we hung out for a bit before they went to Eldersburg, I went to Sam's to play jackbox again, then they took me back so we could have our Family Thanksgiving Saturday.
So, we did that last night and then Sam and Meredith came over for MORE jackbox games and drinking.
I lost my battery into the night especially after coming out with the speech that "I'm important" during our yearly talk.
I don't exactly feel that way just yet, and I don't exactly feel heard all the time, but I'm working on it.
Anyway, I'm losing steam because I just want to go back to my life, but my life is about to change.
We've all (I mean EVERYONE) been brainstorming what I should be doing in my future, but the only step I'm taking at the moment is to find a job here in Maryland that can support me if I'm sick again.
It's the first step in the grand plan to move back here.
So, it might take a while to 'get my life back' so I should do my best to live it as it is now.
But there is talk of me working for Northrop Grumman, living at Sam/Meredith's apartment building until I work on and finish the Richardson house for me to live in.
As for the house up in Maine, 22 Spillanes, I'm still working on that.
But I have sent a bunch of applications so far, and I'm curious how those will go... except Northrop, those have been denied by computers for not reaching minimium requirements.
Anyway, I'm enjoyin my nerd life with a small emphasis on ~trying~ to date with minimal effort.
I also want to get strong again.
That should be a New year's resolution.
Oh, and I started the chatbot again.
I made some progress with a program that simply removes empty lines at the beginning of a file in a directory.
So, as I'm writing this, there's an empty line after I input the command "r!date" in nvim, and I just need to run the program and that will be taken care of!
Next step is to automate the program happening when I do things, which will take me to dot files I think.
