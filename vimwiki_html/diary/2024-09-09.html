Today sucked.
I spent the whole day at the hospital and here I am again.
I really don't feel like journalling about this with the way I feel and everything else going on, but I think it's important.
The first thing I can't get off my mind is how bad my vision is right now, like I can't see a goddamn thing, even this text 2 feet from my face is blurry - I hope this is mostly temporary.
Okay, with that off my mind, let me start at the beginning of today.
I went in to do a total of 4 things: bloodwork, platlet infusion, bone-marrow biopsy, and CT scan.
They were able to get two additional things out of me that I wasn't expecting (was I wrong or did they scam me? I don't know).
So the bloodwork was pretty easy; everyone was nice, the receptionist recognized me and helped me with my schedule, the dude taking my blood talked to me about my Retroid Pocket and some Nintendo stuff including the minish cap I played, it was good.
Then I went upstairs to get the platlets I know I needed.
I waited for a while and did really well at chess, I also was listening to some fire music this morning with my buds, and right about at 9 (2 hours after the blood draw) I finally got in and had a pretty busy looking nurse.
I usually don't care about that, but she was not very attentive or helpful for the time I actually needed her.
I was gaming Zelda most of the time (and I was getting really frustrated at the sky dungeon because I ran through it like 4 times and got a "game over" each time - seriously there's no health to pick up in that dungeon) but then she said she wanted to do an EKG on me, and I asked why to which she didn't have an answer.
After the assistant brought over the equipment, I denied the EKG because I was supposed to be heading to my next appointment and I didn't want to do something that wasn't necessary.
My nurse huffed over and explained it's just what everyone who goes through a BMT (bone-marrow-transplant) has to do - but, I'm not going throught a transplant, so I knew she was too flustered to even talk.
I accepted my fate and did the EKG as long as she called the CT place that I was going to be late to.
The Nurse Practitioner came to convince me to do the EKG, but I already had it done by then, so I must have stirred something up.
So, I was late to the CT scan at 1130 after they pulled everything out and off of me and I was bleeding through my favorite KP hoodie zip-up.
They helped me clean the blood, but I suspect it was from me walking literaly through the hospital and through the parking garage to get to my appointment (also, today I've had higher blood pressure - 150/90 which is more than my usual 120/70).
So, since I was late, I knew it would happen, but I got pushed.
While I waited Dr. Ambinder called to tell me he wanted me to stay at the hospital to get Inotumomeb (I think... the one that goes for the CD-22 markers).
Apparentley, my blood has all the cancer cells in it now.
So, I made a bunch of calls thinking I would just stay at the hospital and tried coordinating that.
I finished the CT scan after drinking terrible contrast and went back to the Weinburg building to get the Bone-marrow biopsy.
Same nurse practitioner, she talked about the risks so I could consent and of course the one I ask about is not getting a full sample.
She listed a few reasons, one of which was there was too much disease and it becomes hard to get the aspirate.
Well, that happened, and she had to dig a lot to get what she needed (they were able to get everything though).
It hurt a lot this time.
Then they went for the core sample, and that was also hard.
I sucked it up for the most part just knowing what they were doing to my back-hip.
Anyway that was over and the NP told me to probably go home instead of wait to go to the hospital since it would take a while to get a bed ready anyway.
But, that just prompted me to go to my last appointment: the Echocardiogram - which I learned is the ultrasound of your heart and the Electrocardiogram is the EKG one.
Anyway I was on a table for 20-25 minutes why this dude felt up my chest and he finished and told me everything looks good.
Thank god he was cool, most people just say they talk about it or whatever, but he just straight up told me it "looked good" but he couldn't confirm anything (lol).
Going back a bit, while I was waiting for the bone-marrow, I had some time to waste and I was hungry so I got the Subway in the cafeteria.
The only thing of note there was that I asked for a water cup, she said she didn't have any, so I asked "can I just use this cup?" and she took that as "I will buy this cup".
A little annoying, I wanted to take some vengence, but the only thing I really did was throw out the receipt so that I couldn't be reimberrsed but the Kite company.
Also, I called them and they confirmed that they'll be paying for this time of treatment, but I asked for it in writing and they still haven't deleivered.
I called them during my platelet infusion around 10 or so (just keeping this for records).
Okay, then I went home very upset and sad after all my stuff today.
I was very sad and even cried in the laundry room since Collin was around my bedroom gaming.
I went downstaris because mom wanted to be around me too, I could tell.
After some alone time we talked and I broke down for a second.
We talked about faith and maybe a therapist, but unfortunately, I didn't get much.
I'd talk to a therapist maybe, but in the end, this disease is just something I have to walk through one way or another.
It'll suck, but I have to do it and I'll be a new person on the other side of it.
I bitched a little more and then Mackenzie came over and had some chili and we played "Coup" which I think she actually liked.
And while we were playing, I got a call from the hospital.
Okay back up a little.
Fitz called me to chat, Collin went to get me some steroids because before that Dr. Ambinder called and said I was NOT going in tonight.
So, this call to go in was a surprise and I was not happy about it since I was expecting to game a little and sleep in my own bed.
Anyway, I asked about going in the next morning, but the shift nurse said she would just call the next person on the list, and apparently I was prioritized over 10 other patients.
So, here I am, typing today up after talking to the funneist night shift doctor and having a very chill nurse who is pretending to poke me so we can get a team to place my IV.
The plan was supposed to be tomorrow for the immunotherapy, but I guess I'm important enough were people are staying late to prepare the medicine in pharmacy.
So, that's what we're doing now, I'm just waiting for them to get the drug in me.
I'm a little dissapointed because I wanted to chill tonight and they were going to let me sleep and everything (I was even going to have a gummy, but that went out the window with this treatment).
But, I'm also glad were starting earlier rather than later.
Tomorrow I will update on when Sam came over yesterday and he, Meredith, Collin, and Abby hung out with me and we got Cava.
