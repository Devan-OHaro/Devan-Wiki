Okay, this time I have a half excuse.
I'm trying right now to piece together everything I've done since the 12th, so I'm using my photos from snapchat and other context clues to see what I did.
Mom is bugging me with a million questions about my current pain, but she did tickle my back a little so I can't be too mad.
So, I think that Monday, I was pretty bored and didn't do much, maybe talked to Mackenzie about the Cameron situation (oh, boy do I have an update).
Then Tuesday the only thing I found in snapchat was the iconic photo of Collin and I gaming, so we definitely played Valorant that day.
We also went to the hospital thinking I had an appointment, but turns out I was wrong and it was Friday instead (whoops) and so we turned that into a grocery store run where we got healthy stuff for Mom and Dad to return to.
We also got three porterhouse steaks and cooked them different ways.
Collin disagrees on the legitimacy of the trial, but in the end, the grilled steak beat the butter basted, and reverse sear.
I don't have much on what happened the next day other than it being Wednesday and remembering that we had to get Mom and Dad from the airport late at night and Collin and I were invited to the Orioles game before that.
So we went to the game and then returned to get them, we got Taco Bell on the way there and ate at home, but the Taco bell order didn't have the extra meat and sauce Collin payed extra for.
Well, it did, but it was in-place-of instead of in addition to.
Then we got the parents, played some more games and then the next morning is my excuse.
I felt these terrible chest pains around 4 am that morning and after about an hour of it, asked Collin to take me to the ER.
They could find much wrong with me.
EKG was fine, ultrasound was good, Xray, CT scan, all good.
They said there was a small amount of inflimation around the heart and said that could be it, so just deal with the pain and take some ibuprofen.
Since then, I've been having random pains all in my chest and back.
I think it's just some form of infliation from the cancer and stuff, but I don't know much and have been dealing with this for a while.
I'll be honest, I'm a little scared this will get worse if things go wrong and I don't want to deal with this, so I just have to beat cancer again for the rest of my life I guess.
Anyway, there was a nurse who wasn't assigned to me but covered my nurse's lunch.
She kept coming in to "steal" our supplied (even if it wasn't there) and just to check in.
She helped me leave the hospital even though my nurse was back, and walked me out.
I didn't have the guts to ask for a number or anything - part of it was that I'm still not sure what I want yet...
Do I want a relationship at this time yet? I don't know.
Anyway we left the hospital, had celebratory Pho mom picked up and I just chilled in bed for the rest of the day.
The next day was the same - just YouTube videos and Instagram reels.
I did however order one of the biggest pizzas with mom and dad - 30", it was crazy and I was very high when ordering it, so either the guy I was talking to was even more high or I couldn't understand a lot of what he was doing.
I started Saturday like that too, just chilling in bed, but Mackenzie and I had a cooking class.
It was interesting, we were barely taught - like the chef told us more about his history than any teaching.
We learned some knife skills and Mackenzie and I were just thrown in because there must have been some organizational talk before we got there.
After we Misanplaced the dish we were making, then we deep-fried some eggplant, then cooked the rest of it into a soup looking thing.
I prepared a cucmber salad because I offered to do it while everyone else worked on their things.
It was pretty easy, but the hard part was learning the dynamic of the kitchen - like, what is and isn't allowed.
After we all cooked everything, we sat down and ate with the other couples where I learned that 3 of the other 4 were engineers and the older one wored at JHU APL, so naturally I asked for a job and I got a picture of her business card.
I was talking about stuff when I noticed during the dinner that Mackenzie refered to Cameron as her "boyfriend" and not her ex.
I thought maybe it made the story easier to tell, so I brushed it off... mistake.
So, Mackenzie went home and Mom, Dad, Collin, and Abby came back from their dinner, they were a little drunk so they hung out with me in my room for a bit before going to bed.
That was fun and funny, I have some videos of that on my phone.
I really have no recollection of what happened Sunday.
Monday, Collin and I went to a card store where I got some staples to put in my deck and so far it seems to have NOT HELPED.
Yesterday, I went to dinner with TJ and caught up with him here and stuff, it was fun.
We talked about good-old times and Sam's funny situation about the engagement (I did learn that he "proposed" very, very long ago).
But it was good, I learned of some stuff I'm going to put in the best-man speech like how Caroline is a planner almost to a fault, they're on the same wave-length, TJ and the ski-slope story where he called me and "asshole", probably another one that I hope will come back when I'm not doing this.
But yeah, I miss hanging out with him and all the good times we had before he started living at ocean-city and hersey park (lol).
And today.
Today, I took a walk with Collin and Abby.
We saw the Richardson house and thought of stuff if I went to live there.
We played some magic, I talked to Fitz, before that the floor guys called me about an update on the floor (they finished sanding it from yesterday), I tutored Jameson (Buck) in chemistry, and Finally I ate dinner at 8:30 after Mackenzie arrived and they already ate.
I came down and mom helped me and took me upstairs.
I'm not feeling the best right now, so she annoyed me as I mentioned ealier after I took some pain killers and a gummy.
I started that when I started this entry and now I'm here a little high at Wed Aug 21 09:51:23 PM EDT 2024.
It was a long update and I want to go back to no excuses and do this more as well as my programming work.
I'll leave it at that and the fact that I might expand on some of the stuff here since I wasn't in the best of mind writing it.
Okay, thanks.
