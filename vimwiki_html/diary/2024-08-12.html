So, i learned about the string stuff yesterday, but there's a lot to practice to get the hang of it.
There's a project the chapter is taking me through right now, but before I really got started, Collin got back and we played some Magic.
Before we really got into ~that~, we played some AoE with Chris and Sam and after a bit we started cooking dinner (Salmon, Cucumber salad, and rice).
We played more Magic, finished dinner, and Collin left for his next hockey game.
I had an edible and Chris and Sam wanted me to play, but I was non-functioning after the first play.
I played some Rocket League, watched some YouTube and did a classic dad where I fell asleep on the couch and found my way upstairs and woke up super late.
Here I am Journaling while the animals yell at me for food, but I feel like Mackenzie or Collin would have done it, so I'm not falling for their jedi mind tricks.
Though as I type this, Louie is right on the chair with me, which is a lot even for him.
So, I'm going to spend this day mostly programming and gaming with some work probably.
I've been really off the wagon trying to eat healthy, so I'm going to make an effort today and maybe go to the grocery store.
