Today was good.
I felt very productive by reading my book, cleaning my room, stretching, vacuuming, organizing my things to take to Maine.
I also had fun by playing my games, going to TJ's, finally playing Warhammer.
It was a good day.
Meditation came easy to me today and I think that's because of all the things I did in-character, if you will.
So, I don't need to go into the details about everything, but I was happy with all the good that came from today and all the diveristy in activites.
I think that's how I operate well - I need to do a little bit of a lot of different things.
That's how I've been reading so much recently: I've been reading just a few pages of a different book as soon as I feel a little bored of the other ones.
So, I should start making my activities shorter-lived and do a lot of them to get stuff done and be happier.
Besides that revelation, I feel a little anxious to go back to Maine, but I'm also happy to see my friends and work again.
I think it will be a good and short trip.
And I know I'll be going back, so nothing to worry about or to miss here or there.
Like I said, keep things short and interesting.

Gratitude:
I'm thankful for Collin reaching out to me to show me the Tokyo Treat box that he finally got in the mail.
He's a good brother.

Forgiveness:
I forgive myself for not paying a lot of attention to Mackenzie.
I love her and I know she knows that.
I'll be back soon and we'll be together for an extended period of time.
In fact I just texted her about dinner tomorrow night before I leave and wanted to make sure she was there.
She hearted the message, so I know that we're super close too.
I love my siblings.
