Jeez, the last thing I feel like doing is updating this and reflecting on the suck of the last few days at this terrible place.
So, they weren't going to start my treatment Monday night, but they pulled strings I guess and thought it was important enough to make others stay late.
I got the immunotherapy like at 11pm Monday and I slept through it for the most part, no big deal.
But the next morning I felt like shit and was cold, had a fever, couldn't feel my fingers, it was terrible, so obviously they worried and then my heart rate went up, my blood pressure went down.
I was in terrible shape and I admit it.
Collin came to see me at some undisclosed time because I was just trying to sleep it off the whole day.
I feel bad that I wasn't able to entertain him at all, but I'm happy he was here.
He passed me off to mom and she made me feel a little better too buy rubbing my back and stuff.
I passed out and the next day I felt better.
Dad visited me and brought some Popeye's chicken sandwiches and we talked about his court case.
Mom visited soon after and she also brought food.
This is where it gets a little fuzzy, because I think she dropped some stuff off, and Collin also bought a Subway sandwich the day before and then it didn't get refrigerated... idk.
But I did end up eating most of the stuff she brought because these steroids are getting the better of me.
There's been a million conversations of when I'm supposed to leave, but right now the plan is ~today~ <span id="-fingers crossed"></span><strong id="fingers crossed">fingers crossed</strong> they were back and forth about the fever and the platlets and I really don't like the doctor I was dealing with before today.
I think he was the same doctor who discharged me with the stomach issues and didn't have a clue about what was going on.
Anyway, I'm not too thrilled with in-patient doctors here; they seem to have zero skills with people and effectively communicating what is going on and they never take any responsibility for their decisions.
So, drama.
But, after a couple of sleepless nights, I should be ready to leave today after they place a PICC line in me and then I have to start going to IPOP since they are worried about my platlets.
Collin is in the hospital now and he's grabbing us lunch so I hope he can stay until I'm ready to go, but who knows when that will actually be.
He he is.
