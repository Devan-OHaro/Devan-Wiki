<p>
I just had lunch with Uncle Dan.
It was enlightening, I wish I could encapsulate everything he said, but he just had so much to talk about.
The important stuff I think I got out of it was:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
My journey is my own and I should do what makes me feel fufilled.

<li>
I should look into self-healing options

<li>
I should give to the community to help myself too

</ol>
<p>
And those are the major things I got other than some specific stuff like looking into X and reading Y.
But, I still think he helped me realize there are more resources out there versus what I've been doing.
I want to keep him as a close contact for a while.
He's someone with a lot of connections and someone who has the resources to help out and even better - he wants to help out.
I want to keep him in my life.
