I just went on a walk with Mackenzie and we talked about journalling, so I wanted to do an entry before getting on with my day.
Last I recorded was the day after Sam and Meredith were here.
That day I was pretty bored since I didn't have anything to do, but I played games and relaxed for the most part.
The next day, Mackenzie came over right before I left for lunch at Glory Days with Gpop.
She said she was going to come over after I get back.
I saw Gpop, Nona, and Aunt Kristie for lunch and we talked about small updates with everything.
Then I got a haircut in Eldersburg real fast.
I went home and chilled and talked to Fitz while eating the rest of my buffalo chicken salad from lunch.
I did that until I saw Mackenzie and we talked more about her situation and how she just wants to break out of it.
I have given her everything I can, and she knows what she needs to do, but she just actually needs to do it.
I'm hoping that journalling will help her now, but we'll get to that.
We then met Collin and Abby after their trip to her brother's place at Mimi's for dinner.
I tried to get Mimi to change the location of her perscription pickup and that was a hassle to explain, but overall we still had a good time.
We joked with her and googled some ugly girl and said it was my girlfriend that she would FaceTime.
I'm starting to get concerned with Mimi's well-being.
She is struggling to understand some basic things and looks like she's on autopilot.
I'll have to spend more time with her before anything happens.
After Mimi's we played a game of Dominion and Mackenzie actually got into it even with the steep learning curve and her current disposition.
After that, we "went to bed" and played some video games.
I went down to watch TV which was just YouTube that I passed out to.
Collin and Abby followed me down to make food, but I was asleep before they went back up.
I woke up late and found myself downstairs kinda working on programming stuff before doing a walk with Mackenzie.
We talked about journalling and structuring it a little more make it work for both of us.
I want to put it into practice, so I'm going to think of something I want to work on and take step one to solving it.
Both Mackenzie and I talked about how we stuggle to know when we're in the "sunk cost" falacy in relationships, so we talked about what to do with that.
I said we should learn to rely on our friends and hear what they are saying as outsiders to the situation.
Maybe that's something I can communicate to Sam about his whole thing.
Anyway, it's also important not to overvalue efforts other people put into relationships.
It's easy for us to overvalue other people's efforts I think because whenever we have someone special to us, it's rare to have those efforts above the bare minimum.
Mackenzie also brought up the whole upbringing thing, so I hypothesized that we overvalue "acts of service" and "physical touch" a lot since we didn't get that as kids much.
So, that's a brief overview of what I think might be a possibility of my issues in relationships.
Lastly, to finish this entry, my plan for the day is to finish this chapter of "managing strings" in the python book and maybe work on some AoE before gaming with Collin when he gets back from his hocky game.
