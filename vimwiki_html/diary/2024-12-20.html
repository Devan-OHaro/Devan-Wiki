Today was relatively short.
I woke up late mostly trying to avoid interactions with dad after last night, and then I called Mackenzie and then mom.
Mom told me she was downstairs in the middle of a interview and so I made coffee.
After she was clearly still busy, I went upstairs and started my <span id="-Codecademy"></span><strong id="Codecademy">Codecademy</strong> course for the day.
She called me down and we debriefed and she told me that she pointed him in the right direction and affirmed that I was right and that I did everything I was supposed to.
We hugged, she went to do another call, and I went upstairs to continue my course, Mackenzie called and she reminded me of emailing Paul.
Mom called after that and told me that dad got irritated when she brought the issue back up this afternoon, so I was told to avoid him more.
I started reading <span id="-The Dhammapada"></span><strong id="The Dhammapada">The Dhammapada</strong> again and then dad brought me down.
He told me he was sorry, I forgave him, and he said everything that is wrong and what needs to be done.
After a long discussion, we agreed on some things, but he disagreed on the value of certain changes and money related items.
My takeaway is that he agrees to get help and find tools to help him calm down in certain situations and that he should relinquish control of a lot of his responsibilities.
We disagreed on which ones.
I think he needs to lower his expectations for everything, learn to listen better, stop fearing uncertainty, and value money less.
That's the summary of everything - I don't need to get into all the anecdotes we made and the progression of conversation, but he is potentially on a path to fix some of his anger issues.
He asked me to recommend a book for him - I'll have to think about it.
But, after that I talked to Fitz and it ended with his present arriving and it was an awesome Shogi set, so that will be fun to learn.
I made some mushroom soup and debriefed again with mom who talked about the therapy option a little, so that's probably going to happen.
I had soup and a yam for dinner and the parents are going out to eat.
I did a short meditation session and I feel calm, but it wasn't my best session.
Now, I'm journalling and feeling strong about the rest of the night before getting Collin.
I want to relax and read my book and maybe <span id="-Komi"></span><strong id="Komi">Komi</strong> or <span id="-Zen"></span><strong id="Zen">Zen</strong> and watch some warhammer stuff.

Gratitude:
I'm thankful for mom.
She is strong, and I enjoy our meaningful conversations.
I'm also thankful for dad.
Regardless of what has happened, I know he has good intent (most of the time) and to see past that is up to me, to act upon it is up to him.

<p>
Forgiveness:
I forgive myself for not doing the Vim and python work for the past few days.
I was supposed to do it yesterday and today, but other things happened and I'll just do it again as soon as possible.
