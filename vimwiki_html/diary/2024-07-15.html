Woke up this morning pretty well.
Got ready for Dana-Farber and had a nice coffee on the way.
I was playing my Retro console for a bit and looking at other jobs/educational prospects.
I'm really liking the idea of studying some more programming and signing up for a software engineer bootcamp with MIT.
That'll give me time to think about other job options here or in Maryland.
There's also just other government contractors who will love me and my experience.
But that's on my mind.
Maire is a little on my mind.
Just trying to figure out how much more we will see each other and how much it's worth it to be honest.
I think we're both on the same page with interest level - enough to see each other, but not enough to make it inconvienent.
The hospital had me do a PET scan for this Lymphnode in my groin... hopefully it's not cancer again.
We'll see.
Finally, I was supposed to have the GitKraken meeting at work today, but I couldn't join the link because the "host" didn't start the meeting.
Code 109 (IT) and I were talking about how weird that was - probably going to have to reschedule the meeting... again.
There's a lot on my mind right now, so I thought it best to at least type it all out.
The only thing to do moving forward is to prepare for what I can, that is, start this programming stuff and complete the house a little if I'm going to move back south; and accept what already is, whatever the results of the PET scan are.
