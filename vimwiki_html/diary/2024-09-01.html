Here we are again, me apologizing.
I'll try and piece everything together, because it started off slow since I last updated and then it got kinda busy.
Like I know I have to update Fallout: New Vegas stuff and Spy X Family I think.
Anyway, let me get to that.
Okay, the first thing that popped up on my saved snapchat pictures was the Booster box I got for Collin and I.
So, I think we opened a few of those packs when he got home late that night for whatever reason he was out.
We really milked opening those packs, in fact, we just finished opening them last night - 6 in a row at that though haha.
I don't think much happened in the following days, I think the weekend had a little of me coordinating with Dr. Ambinder to get some more pain killers and steroids to help with the cancer-inflamation.
At least that the theory of what's going on, it doesn't seem like my doctor feels like investigating too much, so it must just be par for the course when he sees cases like this.
I have to say, other thatn the inflammed splein from last time, this is the first time I have like... pain from the cancer itself - every other time it's been from the treatment.
Anyway, I remember Collin doing stuff over the weekend and being busy and I think Abby got my my medicine at one point, so that was cool that she helped me out and I won't forget that.
Monday rolled around and I think I was just bored at home doing literally nothing.
Maybe that's when I watched Spy X Family without Collin, I kinda felt bad, but I just want to finish these shows at this point.
Tuesday I had my appointment according to SnapChat.
We went in too early so I feel bad for dragging Collin to the hospital unnecessarily twice now for extra time, but I enjoyed my time with him regardless.
I signed all the "consents" for the procedure for them to take my blood.
I had to stop taking the steroids for a little while for this procedure so the pains came back.
I remember the next few days being sore and hungry a lot and not having a good time.
I was supposed to go into the hospital again Thursday, but I was able to do the "training" on how to use chlorohexadine wipes when I was there early Tuesday.
So Thursday (I think) mom and I had a chat in my room and I told her my true feelings about everything...
OH, I totally forgot, Monday I had the accupunture or whatever with Mom and Aunt Kristie's "friend".
I didn't get much from it to be honest, I opened up to her before starting and the one thing she probably opened my eyes to is that I don't really have an outlet for my feelings.
No person, no God, I mean the closest I can probably get is this thing - my journal.
So, maybe that's what I'll do for now.
But yeah, I don't confess to people and I still wasn't too keen on confessing my feelings to this stranger even though she was a very open person.
It's not that I don't like her, I just felt weird, but I did break down a little during that talk.
Then we did the accupuncture.
I don't think I liked it.
It was just getting stabbed and then she burned some incense on me.
The whole thing was mostly painful, but we got panera afterwards with Aunt Kristie and Delaney.
I feel bad that I don't normally talk to those two outside of family events, they are the some of the most down-to-earth family members that I have.
But, I tried to keep the conversation, even though I've been bad at that the past few years.
...okay getting back to mom in my bedroom talking.
I told her about the outlet thing and that I truly am scared and depressed.
Call me stubborn, but I just don't want to do anything.
This is how I deal with this stuff, just letting the world beat me up until I have my chance.
Mom heard me, but I don't think she really listened, because she keeps suggesting things for me to get out of this "funk", but that's really the opposite of what I said.
It was a hard talk and I was very emotional and I'm happy she was there - in fact, I'm happy she's still trying to get me out of the "funk" that isn't really there because I know she cares.
It's just frustrating to feel like Debby-downer every time I turn down her idea to walk or do something healthy for myself.
I don't know, I just know this is usually how I mentally survive these things, I know when to celebrate and I know when to chill the fuck out... even if it's to a fault.
Okay, then I had my procedure Friday.
Nothing crazy, just placed a line in my neck, I was conscience-sedated for that and then they took me to phareisis to move the blood around and take what they needed.
Mom was in there "annoying" me but, I'm glad for it.
We had snacks, I tried to sleep, it was a loud machine, and bright and a lot of people were in there, so that was hard.
Mom eventually left for work and I was alone until I went back to the interventional radiology to have the line taken out.
There I met Collin and he gave me half a subway sandwich which was perfect.
We chated for the half hour I needed to stay before we met Abby in the waiting room and opened a Magic pack and she gave me an umbreon keychain.
We made our way home and I chilled for the rest of the day.
I think I had a gummy and Collin and Abby and I ate wings and watched some season two of Attack on Titan.
That was really fun to watch a second time and to be a little high.
Then yesterday, Collin and I played some Magic, we went to the store to get Mom some flowers for her birthday and snacks, and then I got invited to eat Ramen with Sam and Chris.
I didn't feel like going out, but I haven't played with those guys online for a few weeks now, so I felt like I owed them and then I drove the farthest too (sigh).
It was fun though, Meredith was there too, and we all had a pretty good conversation that seemed like it wasn't about to end until the place was stacking stools and we closed them out.
Went home and played some lethal company.
We didn't get too far, but it was a nice intro into the new mechanics that were put in there since we last played.
Went to bed, woke up today, had some coffee before mom and dad started moving stuff and getting ready for her birthday party, then I went up and showered and changed my bandage out.
I played some chess and rocket-league and noticed I was tilted for some reason.
Not too happy with some of the voice comms I had with one of my teammates.
So, I decided journalling was probably the best outlet.
I feel good that I did it, I always do.
So, the plan is to try and socialize at this party before I dissapear, eat some pizza, and chill.
I noticed that I'm 183 lbs this morning so that's like 10 lbs more than normal while I was in Maine.
Dad said I was too skinny, but I was really happy and now I'm fat.
Again, dad said I'm not fat, but I feel it - the sweat is coming easier, the heart-rate is high on easy things.
I shouldn't complain if I'm not going to do anything.
Just have to make sure it's not impacting my health to a high degree, that's all.
I can hear Mimi downstairs - so, I'll have to talk to her soon.
Wish me luck.
