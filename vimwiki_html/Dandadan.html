I was pretty regular watching these episodes as they came out, but I took a pause two Thursdays ago.
I was expecting three new episodes today, but I forgot that I was already on episode 11 and I only had one left before the end of the season.
They left it on a crazy cliffhanger.
The first few episodes I watched like 5 or 6 in a row and that explained the whole "Turbo Granny" thing and how Okurun has his powers.
It also set up the show which is classic anime where they all live under the same roof at Granny's house.
Then there was the other arc with the dancing mother as a ghost who loved the pink haired girl.
Next, was the lochness monster arc in the water world of the school which had a bit of fanservice and stuff, but still fun.
Finally, they introduced the new dude character that Okurun is jealous of for being Momo's childhood friend.
They introduced the animated body exhibits as characters, then went to the new guy's house in another part of Japan and the cliffhanger was that the guys discovered a hole in the haunted house and Momo is being attacked by random guys in the hotspring.
