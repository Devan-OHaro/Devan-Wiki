I guess I haven't been as up-to-date with this than I thought.
I finished the third volume recently, but I took a break - I think for TJ's wedding stuff over the weekend.
But, it's still a good read.
The MC met the famous cosplyer and obviously the romantic interest (RI) adores her.
This was all after they finshed her first cosplay.
Anyway, they agreed to do a meetup, but the small famous cosplayer girl isn't too happy about it.
Then her sister is younger, but gives off Wiz vibes from Konosuba where she's there and adds to the conversation, but is mostly oblivious and has big boobs.
They scoped out a place to do the cosplay and the photography sister is there with the three of them.
Obviously, RI is starting to get feelings for the MC.
I got to read some more today, so that means opening up the fourth volume.

I just finished the first volume today and it was really fun.
I like how flustered the MC gets and how much the girl shows him and flirts with him.
Classic "she likes him immediately even though it doesn't make sense" but I love it.
I like how Manga is in my head too since I can make the scenes go how I want.
Anyway, they started making her cosplay and now they're friends and I'm assuming they will play around with the liking each other and fumbling around for a while before anything happens.
But maybe I should read a manga like Horimiya where they get together early.
Anyway, I know this isn't a real diary, but since this is my first Manga I'm writing my feelings and I have Marissa suggesting things for me haha.
