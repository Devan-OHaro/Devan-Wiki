Just started Doom. I love the badass feel of the game.
Just running and gunning.
So, I just fixed the relay and have a status report on the mars base and now I have to stop a meltdown. 
I plan on making all my upgrades to whatever can kill more stuff rather than health or radar.
This will be a fun playthrough.

I like it and get bored of it for the same reason, it's just a simple game about killing demons.
I just saved the mars base from a meltdown and destroyed all the "Filters" that convert the demon energy to clean energy.
Now I need to kill the scientst cult leader for trying to open the portals.
