I read about the "immature" and the "wise" today.
I felt like there wasn't much to get out of these passages to be honest.
A lot of them were like, "The immature sufferes because he is bad, the wise is happy because he is good".
Like, I have no idea what to make of half of that stuff because nothing is defined at all.
I mean, the best part was probably the fact that it said the immature don't admit to being immature.
I guess self-reflection was the only real message I got from it.

I'm starting this because if I don't, I never will.
I can't really get into the details of the introduction I finished yesterday, but I can say that it was very insightful and a perfect map for what is to come with buhddism.
I want to re-read the intro at some point, like I'm sure I will with all the other passages.
But today I read Mind, Vigilance, Flowers, and I think I finished up the Twin-passages.
I liked the "Mind" one where it talked about what a sharp mind can do and how the key to it is meditation.
So, I have to emphasize meditaion a little more and learn more about my subconscience mind.
