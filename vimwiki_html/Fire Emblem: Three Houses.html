I played a lot of this game during my trip to California with Collin.
There's not much to the story.
In fact, most of it was the first hour with a goddess looking person invading your mind and stopping time for you to not die in a situation.
After that, you become the professor of a school and take over teaching one of the houses.
I chose the blue one with the blonde dude.
There's a girl in there I'm trying to romance, Ingrid.
A couple battles here and there and lots of dialoge later and here we are.
I'm excited to play the game, it looks like a lot of content!
