Yesterday, I did a quick "statistics project".
I just wanted to get something done for the day since it's been a while.
I'll probably do more today to keep the ball rolling.

Just a quick update from yeseterday.
Oh... I updated yesterday.
Well, today I started the data science class on Codecademy and that seems promising.
I'll keep working on the Vim stuff while I'm at it.

So, I didn't get too far today, I spent a lot of time learning vim and neovim since the program wants to use an API to control it.
I think this will be a good lesson for me, so I'll keep looking into it and learn more about the commands for vim and stuff.
It'll be useful to know how to operate vim like that.
But, ChatGPT has a version of the program I want to work on, so I'll keep learning from it's attempt.
Until I make the program, I'll keep it's version up to learn from and then I'll move on.

I didn't do anything today, but I did log a lot of ideas of where I want this project to go in my diary (so details are there).
The important stuff is that I need to fill this database regularly and that probably means daily.
I figured an easy way to do that was to make an app for my phone.
The app would ask for random pieces of information that you have to fill in - in addition to the daily logging of journalling, gratitude, forgiveness, mood, etc.
Finally, the app will have a fail-safe if you don't respond.
Something like notifying a trusted person when you don't acknowledge the app's notifications.
And then, finally, sending all important passwords and data to the trusted person.
Okay, that's a lot, but first we're going to start with prompts for the daily stuff and inputting it into the right file.
After that the prompts will put stuff into a data table.

Okay, I just finished the project I started yesterday and I didn't even ask ChatGPT for it's help.
Well... okay, I used the stuff from yesterday, but when I ran into issues by making the code what I wanted, I was able to solve the issues pretty easily.
I'm happy that I got a program to search for a keyword and output all the results to a file now.
Next up I'll be searching for multiple keywords now and finding the context between them I think.

I put this in my journal entries, but I started working on this a little more recently.
I won't get too philisophical, but I realized that just inching forward a little bit every once in a while is still progress and I want to keep it up.
So, I'm doing a little at a time.
Very little.
Anyway, I started with having ChatGPT help me write some programs.
First one was just removing an empty line from the top of a text file.
Then I organized the utility program like that one into a directory and had another program call it so that it would iterate through a directory.
And today I started writing more utilities to the same program to call upon.
This next one will search for a keyword in all the files in a directory and output the lines and their metadata to a file.
I stil need to make a program to call upon the method I just mentioned and I need to change some conditional statements, but so far so good.
We'll probably check it tomorrow or later today.

Okay, I did some work since Tuesday I promise.
I worked on lists and dictionaries the past three days.
Wednesday I started lists, Thursday I did some list projects, and today I did almost all of dictionaries.
It went smoother than I thought, maybe that's because actually practicing is smoothing out my skills or something.
Nothing is more annoying than getting dumb errors like printing the wrong data type or something stupid like that.
But in reference to printing things, that is where a lot of errors I have come to play, so this most recent program of mine dealing with a fantasy adventure inventory didn't even print anything at first.
I just ran the program to update values and then used the command line to print what I wanted, which was actually super nice (I also did this with making a chess board, my own version of the project they recommended).
So, yeah, it's going pretty well.
I mean I'm still not done "week" one, so I gotta pick it up or just tame my expectations.
Overall, I'm happy with the process, it's fun.
I'm hoping soon we'll work with actual data.

Just did a decent amount of learning.
Most of it is still review, but I did learn about the 'None' data type and exception handling.
I wrote the "collatz" program which was actually kinda fun.
It was a good finish for the chapters 1-3 review in the ~Automate~ book.
Still using the "Mu" program too which is weird but I'm hoping the book will get into telling us how to use the system a little more; maybe when files are involved?
