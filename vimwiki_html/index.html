They just completed the labrynth for the second trial to become a first class mage.
Badass fight scenes.
Fitz said he'd probably like the show and I agree.
I have two episodes left and I'm ready to watch them and see how they finally finish the exams.

Just finished Frieren for now. 
It was really good.
Lot's of life lessons in there I hop not to forget.
Mostly, it's about the small things, and not to have a tear-ful goodbye when you know you'll see them again.
Cool.

Just updating this now (again), but it was pretty good.
Mostly just the main character doing his job change quest.
It was difficult and fun to watch the boss fight.
Super cool power of necromancy in the season finally.
We'll see where that takes him in the next season.

Just updating this now, but last night I wached some solo-leveling to catch up with where I was at.
I rewatched some episodes.
He killed that one executive that was blood thirsty through his dungeons and now has a target on his back since it was a S-rank's brother.
Then he tricked some buisiness into buying their C-rank dungeons.
Yeah nothing crazy, just getting the work in to become A-rank.

Vinland Saga

<p>
I resumed this last night.
It's starting to get good with the king and everything.
Now it'll be a political war and stuff since they were trying to kill the prince actually.
Thorfin was a side character for the most part here.
Anime seems so real when you're high.

Just started Doom. I love the badass feel of the game.
Just running and gunning.
So, I just fixed the relay and have a status report on the mars base and now I have to stop a meltdown. 
I plan on making all my upgrades to whatever can kill more stuff rather than health or radar.
This will be a fun playthrough.

<p>
I like it and get bored of it for the same reason, it's just a simple game about killing demons.
I just saved the mars base from a meltdown and destroyed all the "Filters" that convert the demon energy to clean energy.
Now I need to kill the scientst cult leader for trying to open the portals.
